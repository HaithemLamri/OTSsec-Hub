# **OTSec-Hub**  
This repository contains materials for the **OTSec-Hub** website.  

## **Labs**  
This folder includes hands-on labs for **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**, based on the **Operational Technology (OT) Courses** at **NYU Tandon**, taught by **Professor Mihalis Maniatakos**.  

We have added extra explanations, external links, and updated versions to make everything easier to run.  

### **Lab Syllabus**  

#### **Lab 0: Introduction to Industrial Control Systems**  
This introductory lab familiarizes you with **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**, including **PLCs, Codesys**, simulation tools, and virtual machines.  

#### **Lab 1: Running a Desalination Plant Simulation**  
In this lab, we simulate a **desalination plant** using **Codesys** and **MATLAB**. A pre-configured **Virtual Machine (VM)** is provided.  

#### **Lab 2: Introduction to ICS Security**  
This lab covers the fundamentals of **ICS security**, listing various **attack vectors** and providing **survey papers** on the topic.  

#### **Lab 3: Reverse Engineering ICS Binaries**  
We introduce **ICSRef**, a reverse engineering tool for ICS binaries. The lab includes an **introduction to reverse engineering** and references to related courses.  

#### **Lab 4: Software Fuzzing for ICS Binaries**  
This lab introduces **software fuzzing** and presents key research works such as **ICSFuzz, FieldFuzz, and ICS-Quartz** for fuzzing ICS binaries.
